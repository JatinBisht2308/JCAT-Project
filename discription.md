It is used to display or make a copy content of one or more files in the terminal
⚜️General Syntax:

node wcat.js [options] [filepaths]
option to remove big line break -s
option to add line number to non empty lines -b
option to add line numbers to all lines -n
😚Commands:

    node wcat.js filepath => displays content of the file in the terminal ✅
    node wcat.js filepath1 filepath2 filepath3... => displays content of all files in the terminal in (contactinated form) in the given order. ✅
    node wcat.js -s filepath => convert big line breaks into a singular line break.✅
    node wcat.js -n filepath => give numbering to all the lines.✅
    node wcat -b filepath => give numbering to non-empty lines.✅
    We can mix and match the options.

😬Edge cases:

    If file entered is not found then it gives file does not exist error. ✅
    -n and -b are 2 options which are mutually exclusive so if user types both of them together only the first enter option should work.✅
    -s and any or both -n and -b present then -s will be executed first and then -n and -b according second rule.✅
